📊 Company Analysis & Profit Prediction

This project involves analyzing a company's sales and financial data to uncover key business insights and predict profitability using machine learning.
🔍 Key Steps:

    Data Exploration & Cleaning:
    Loaded Excel data using pandas, handled missing values, removed duplicates, converted date formats, and engineered time-based features.

    EDA & Visualization:
    Explored correlations using heatmaps and visualized profit distribution by sales channels. Key insight: the Store channel was the most profitable, generating over 18 million in profit.

    Feature Engineering & Modeling:
    Selected and transformed features for modeling. Trained and compared multiple regression models:

        Linear Regression

        Decision Tree

        Random Forest

        XGBoost

    Model Optimization:
    Applied hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV) and cross-validation to improve model performance.

    Evaluation Metrics:
    Assessed models using RMSE, R² score, residual analysis, and learning curves.

📁 Tools & Libraries:

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
